# Upgrading preview releases

## ADR-047 history cleanup

The legacy replay-worker history implementation and its public Java write-session API have
been removed. Projection history is now the only archive writer; `ArchiveBackend` is a
generation-pinned read facade.

Before upgrading, remove every explicit `yano.history.enabled` property, including
`yano.history.enabled=false`. To collect history, configure
`yano.history.projection.enabled=true` and select projection sections or epoch artifacts as
needed. Also remove `yano.account-history.enabled` and legacy `yano.history.worker.*`,
`yano.history.hot-store.*`, `yano.history.datasets.*`, `yano.history.start-mode`,
`yano.history.maintenance.*`, and `yano.history.archive.sqlite.*` properties. Startup rejects
these keys rather than silently ignoring them, and readiness reports `DOWN` while the
configuration error is present.

The removed Java surface includes the replay hot-store/progress/resolver types,
`ArchiveWriteSession`, `ArchiveReceipt`, `ArchiveRetentionCutoff`, and
`DuckLakeWriteSession`. Integrators should use `ProjectionSink` for archive writes and the
read-only repositories exposed by `ArchiveBackend` for queries.

`GET /history/watermark` no longer consults legacy `archive_coverage` metadata. It reports the
projection consistency point or an unavailable response. Existing replay metadata tables are
left inert and are not dropped automatically; current projection archives do not require a
rebuild.
